# AI-Civ-TestUniverse Documentation

Welcome to the AI-Civ-TestUniverse documentation.

## Overview

AI-Civ-TestUniverse is a universal AI-powered testing framework built on constitutional multi-agent architecture. It implements a 10-agent system that collaboratively orchestrates software testing while maintaining strict governance and safety boundaries.

**Core Philosophy:** "Coverage is a lie; Confidence is the product."

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the package
pip install -e ".[all]"

# Run interactive CLI
aiciv

# Start API server
aiciv --api
```

## Architecture

The framework is built around 10 irreducible agents:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Architect | Purpose & Vision |
| Governor | Law & Enforcement |
| Planner | Strategy & Planning |
| Builder | Engineering |
| Operator | Execution |
| Scholar | Memory & Knowledge |
| Scientist | Discovery |
| Economist | Resources |
| Diplomat | Communication |
| Sentinel | Monitoring & Safety |

## The Final Ruleset

1. Purpose outranks intelligence
2. Governance outranks autonomy
3. Boundaries outrank capability
4. Memory outranks speed
5. Structure outranks cleverness
